## How do I check the library for K-12 textbooks?

You can check to see if we have specific curriculum materials here:

[http://www.librarything.com/profile/CSUCI](http:/www.librarything.com/profile/CSUCI)

The search box is in the upper right hand side of the screen and says "Search CSUCI's books"

If we do own the book, they will be located in the curriculum area at the end of the children's section.

## Early Childhood Studies Boeing Grant

Early-childhood student teachers studied \(seniors in ECS undergrad major\)worked to create responsive, high-quality early care and education for children of migrant farmworkers. The students rethink curriculum for young children of migrant farmworkers through their university coursework, by learning from the families and children of the workers, the employers of the families, and the early care and education staff who serve families through licensed programs and who have many years of experience working in Southern California. These activities, if appropriately implemented, can help optimize children's learning in different areas of development. This digital collection contains the activities the student teachers developed and when available images of the items created. Recommended books are available in the Kit section \(exhibithall\)of the Broome Library along with some of the activities.

## Curriculum Collection

At the John Spoor Broome Library, we have a curriculum collection that includes many of the K-8 California adopted textbooks. We currently have a small collection of materials for grades 9-12and are working to expand this area. These items are located at the end of the children's area on the south side of the library and are organized by subject. The items in the curriculum collection do not check out and are for use in the library only.

Our collection is a result of a partnership with Ventura County Office of Education and generous donations from publishers such as National Geographic and Houghton Mifflin Harcourt.

## Consulate of Mexico Textbook Program

In 2010 and 2011, the Broome Library participated in the Spanish Textbook Program through the Consulate of Mexico in Oxnard. We have received textbooks in the areas of history, geography, mathematics, reading, and science.

You can see a list of the available materials here:
