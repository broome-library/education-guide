## How do I check the library for K-12 textbooks?

You can check to see if we have specific curriculum materials here:

[http://www.librarything.com/profile/CSUCI](http:/www.librarything.com/profile/CSUCI)

The search box is in the upper right hand side of the screen and says "Search CSUCI's books"

If we do own the book, they will be located in the curriculum area at the end of the children's section.

## Early Childhood Studies Boeing Grant

Early-childhood student teachers studied \(seniors in ECS undergrad major\)worked to create responsive, high-quality early care and education for children of migrant farmworkers. The students rethink curriculum for young children of migrant farmworkers through their university coursework, by learning from the families and children of the workers, the employers of the families, and the early care and education staff who serve families through licensed programs and who have many years of experience working in Southern California. These activities, if appropriately implemented, can help optimize children's learning in different areas of development. This digital collection contains the activities the student teachers developed and when available images of the items created. Recommended books are available in the Kit section \(exhibithall\)of the Broome Library along with some of the activities.
